# enforce-victims-rule [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/victims/victims-enforcer-legacy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/victims/victims-enforcer-legacy)


## About

This rule provides the logic to scan a Maven's project's dependencies against a database of artifacts with publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). The canonical version of the database is hosted at https://victi.ms and is maintained by Red Hat security teams. 

## Getting Started

A sample project is provided in sample/

To see the victims-enforcer in action run:
```sh
mvn clean package
```

On environments running JDK 1.7 or greater, you ***may*** have to disable _jsse.enableSNIExtension_ for synchronization to work.
```sh
mvn clean package -Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false
```

## Configuration options reference

The following options can be specified as child elements of ```<rule implementation="com.redhat.victims.VictimsRule">```

### baseUrl

   The URL of the victims web service to used to synchronize the local database.

   default: "https://victi.ms"

### entryPoint 

    The entrypoint of the victims webservice to synchronize against

    default: "/service"


### metadata

   The severity of exception to be thrown when a dependency is encountered that matches the known vulnerable database based on metadata. Fatal indicates the build should fail, warning indicates a warning should be issued but the build should proceed.

   allowed : warning, fatal, disabled  
   default : warning


### fingerprint

   The severity of exception to be thrown when a dependency is encountered that matches the known vulnerable database based on a fingerprint. Fatal indicates the build should fail, warning indicates a warning should be issued but the build should proceed.

   allowed : warning, fatal, disabled  
   default : fatal


### updates

   Allows the configuration of the synchronization mechanism. In automatic mode new entries in the victims database are pulled from the victims-web instance during each build. In daily mode new entries are pulled from the victims-web instance only once per day. The synchronization mechanism may be disabled and processed manually for closed build environments.

   allowed : auto, daily, offline  
   default : auto


### jdbcDriver

   The jdbc driver to use for the local victims database. By default victims uses an embedded H2 database.

   default :  org.h2.Driver

### jdbcUrl

   The jdbc connection URL to for the local victims database.

   default : .victims (embedded h2 instance).

### jdbcUser

   The username to use for the jdbc connection.

   default : ""

### jdbcPass

   The password to use for the jdbc connection.

   default : ""
